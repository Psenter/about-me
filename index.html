        <h2>About me:</h2>

        <p>So as you saw in the title my name is Parker, and there isn't much to me to be honest. I <i>really</i> like cats.
            (they are way better than dogs in my opinion.) For the most part I just vibe and don't really do much.
            I would say hands down my favorite drink is apple juice. Another hot take to a lot of people that I have,
            is the fact that I think twizzlers, swedish fish, and dots are the worst thing ever made by mankind.
            Some of my favorite games right now are Inscryption and The Outlast Trials. My favorite artists at the moment are Zillakami, Paris Texas, and Lil Peep.
            Usually when I'm not playing games I'm out doing stuff with friends whether it be taking pictures or just hanging out, you could probably name almost anything
            and we've done it. So yeah, that's a little bit about me, I wasn't really sure what to put for the most part so I kinda just started typing.
            (My girlfriend forced me to put more because she said 'It's not enough.')</p>
